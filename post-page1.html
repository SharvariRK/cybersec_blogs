    <h2 class="sub-heading">Hot Topic Attacks</h2>
    <p class="post-text">1. Ukrainian State Nuclear Power Company Attack-
        The Russian “hacktivist” group called the People’s Cyber Army engaged 7.25 million bots in August 2022 in a bot attack to take the Energoatom website down. It used a flood of garbage web traffic and webpage requests. A disruption of online services lasted for a few hours, but no permanent negative impact remained. The attack was part of a Russian psyops campaign to create fear of a nuclear disaster and terrorize Europeans.</p>
    <p class="post-text">2. Greek Natural Gas Distributor Attack-
        Greek national gas distributor DESFA reported an incidence of a cyber attack in August 2022. The attack impacted part of the company’s IT infrastructure and caused a data leak. The ransomware operation of cybercriminals called Ragnar Locker is holding the stolen data hostage. They demand ransom not to expose sensitive data. The company refused to make a payment.</p>
    <p class="post-text">3. South Staffordshire Water Company Attack-
        In August 2022, the South Staffordshire Water Company reported an attack that caused a network disruption in its internal corporate network and a data loss. A cybercriminal ransomware group threatened to tamper with the water supplied by the company. The company disputed this claim. The criminals demanded payment to not release sensitive files and explain how the network breach happened.</p>
    <p class="post-text">4. Montenegro Government Attack-
        The government of Montenegro's digital IT infrastructure reported an unprecedented cyberattack in August 2022. No data breach occurred. However, certain governmental services and telecommunications experienced disruption, including border crossings and airport operations. The state-owned utility company, EPCG, switched to manual operations as a precautionary measure.</p>
    <p class="post-text">5. UK Military Social Media Breach-
        Hackers took over the Twitter account of the British Army in July 2022. The social media account underwent multiple name and photo changes. The content started promoting contests to win Angry Apes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital art stored on a blockchain. The army’s YouTube page experienced an attack as well. Its name changed to Ark Invest, and the account promoted interviews of Elon Musk talking about cryptocurrency.</p>
